## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

<!--
### Example new and noteworthy
-->

### Faster dependency resolution

TBD: faster for large dependency graphs
TBD: faster for dependencies from Maven repositories
TBD: faster for Android builds

### Incremental build improvements

#### Tracking changes in the order of input files

Gradle now recognizes changes in the order of files for classpath properties as a reason to mark a task like `JavaCompile` out-of-date. The new `@OrderSensitive` annotation can be used on task input properties to turn this feature on in custom tasks.

### Sync can preserve files

With the [Sync](dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.Sync.html) task it is now possible to preserve files that already exist in the destination directory.

    task sync(type: Sync) {
        from 'source'
        into 'dest'
        preserve {
            include 'extraDir/**'
            include 'dir1/**'
            exclude 'dir1/extra.txt'
        }
    }

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 4.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### Ivy Publish plugin takes into account `transitive` attribute declared for dependencies when generating metadata

Previous versions of Gradle did no reflect `transitive="false"` for a dependency in the generated metadata if the `transitive` attribute was set to `false`. To illustrate the change
in behavior, let's assume the following dependency declaration.

    dependencies {
        compile "commons-dbcp:commons-dbcp:1.4", {
            transitive = false
        }
    }

The generated `ivy.xml` will now properly reflect that the given dependency should not resolve any of its transitive dependencies.

    <dependencies>
        <dependency org="commons-dbcp" name="commons-dbcp" rev="1.4" conf="runtime-&gt;default" transitive="false" />
    </dependencies>

Projects consuming published artifacts generated by the Ivy Publish plugin might experience a different dependency graph than observed with earlier versions of Gradle.

### Maven plugin takes into account `exclude` attributes `group` and `module` for dependencies when generating metadata

Previous versions of Gradle did not add exclusions for dependencies in the generated metadata that either use the attribute `group` _or_ `module`. The following dependency declaration
demonstrates those use cases.

    dependencies {
        compile('org.apache.camel:camel-jackson:2.15.3') {
            exclude group: 'org.apache.camel'
        }
        compile('commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils:1.8.3') {
            exclude module: 'commons-logging'
        }
    }

The generated `pom.xml` will now properly reflect the exclusions in the generated metadata. Projects consuming published artifacts generated by the Maven plugin might
experience a different dependency graph than observed with earlier versions of Gradle.

### JNA library has been removed from Gradle distribution

We do not need [JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) anymore so we removed this library from
the Gradle distribution. Plugin authors relying on the library being present now need to ship their own.

### Dependency resolution changes when a Maven module dependency is substituted with a Gradle project dependency

TBD: Previously, the result would include dependencies and artifacts from all configurations of the target project, such as test compilation and runtime dependencies.
TBD: Previously, when the target project did not have a 'runtime', 'compile' or 'master' configuration, the result would include all dependencies and artifacts from all configurations of the target project. When 'runtime' or 'compile' is not defined the 'default' configuration is used instead. A missing 'master' configuration is ignored.

### Dependency resolution changes when a Maven module depends on an Ivy module

TBD: Previously, when the target Ivy module did not define a 'runtime', 'compile' or 'master' configuration, the result would include all dependencies and artifacts from all configurations of the Ivy module. When 'runtime' or 'compile' is not defined the 'default' configuration is used instead. A missing 'master' configuration is ignored.

### Dependency resolution result changes

TBD: As a result of performance improvements, the result includes fewer `ResolvedDependency` nodes, as some nodes are merged. Previous versions of Gradle would include a `compile`, `runtime` and `master` node for transitive Maven dependencies. Gradle now includes a single `runtime` node. The same modules and artifacts are included in the result, and in the same order.
